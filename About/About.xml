This mod makes a handful of small tweaks to the Anomaly DLC that are intended to make the game a bit more enjoyable without changing the gameplay too much.

Full list of tweaks:
- Selecting multiple bioferrite harvesters shows the total amount of bioferrite contained in all of them
- Only checks home maps and any map where colonists are for threats when selecting music (to prevent horror combat/tension music from playing endlessly after running away from a pit gate battle)
